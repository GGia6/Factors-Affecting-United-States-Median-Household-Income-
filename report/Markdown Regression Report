### Introduction
This project investigates how racial demographics relate to median household income across selected states in the United States, with a specific focus on determining which racial group exhibits the lowest correlation with median income above $50,000. The topic is motivated by longstanding socioeconomic disparities within the United States, where racial identity continues to influence labor market outcomes and income distribution. The first part of the project provided an initial exploratory analysis of these patterns. Pearson correlation coefficients calculated for each racial group revealed substantial variation in the strength and direction of associations with median income. The Pacific Islander population displayed the strongest positive correlation, suggesting that states with higher proportions of this group tend to show higher median income. In contrast, the Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native categories showed weak negative correlations. Notably, the American Indian/Alaskan Native category had the lowest correlation with median income above $50,000, indicating little to no meaningful relationship, or a slightly inverse association, between this group’s representation and income levels. These results help establish a foundation for further statistical analysis in the subsequent phase of the project. There is one research question to be evaluated: 

Do racial percentages predict median household income across U.S. States? 

### Methods
To answer this question, a multiple linear regression model is used, with Median Household Income as the response variable and the racial percentage variables (White, Black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, Two or More Races, and Other Race) as predictors. This procedure evaluates whether racial composition collectively contributes to explaining variation in median household income across states.  

Due to many considerations, multiple linear regression is an appropriate test. This test uses two quantitative variables (response and predictor), satisfying structural requirements. Additionally, the model tests whether a group of variables such as; gender, race and population density accurately predict median household income. It also allows for testing the significance of these predictors in relation to median household income.  

 Primarily, the linear regression model started with a total of nine predictors, which proved to be significant with a p-value of 0.002351, which was significant enough to reject the null hypothesis. This is determined as the model was adequate in predicting household median income; therefore, assumptions were checked. After the production of residual plots for each predictor, there was evidence of clustering, funneling, and curvilinearity, which violated regression assumptions for homoscedasticity and linearity/normality. Taking this into consideration, the White, Asian, Pacific Islander, Biracial, and Other Race were removed. Assumptions were still found to be violated, so the female variable was also removed. The new model contained three predictors: male, population density, and the Black race. This model proved to be adequate at predicting median household income with a p-value of 0.01105. The residual plot satisfied linearity by showing mostly flat LOESS lines, meaning the model captures the main trend. Independence is satisfied with the observations since the U.S. states are independent units of analysis. The residual plot satisfied the assumption of homoscedasticity by having a fairly consistent vertical spread across predicted and fitted values. Lastly, the assumption was normality was satisfied since residuals appeared to be centered around zero. Inevitably, due to the small sample size, the residual plots also showed outliers, which should be taken into account with future studies. 


### Results 
The final model to predict median household income included males, Black race, and population density, which showed to be statistically significant with a p-value of 0.01105 and a F-test statistic of 4.181. This allowed for rejection of the null hypothesis that the model is not adequate at predicting median household income, and the alternative hypothesis was accepted.  After looking at the prediction model, one can see that the Black race makes the biggest contribution to median household income, having the highest beta value, whereas population density makes a negative contribution. To evaluate the accuracy of the model with predicting income, Alabama and Virginia were chosen as test predictions. The model predicted a 95% confidence interval of (54819.08, 80378.33) for Alabama, and a 95% confidence interval of (60416.09, 86014.42) for Virginia. The actual respective median household income values for Alabama and Virginia are \$66,659 and $92,090, respectively. The 95% confidence interval for Alabama included the actual value, whereas Virginia did not. In the context of the study, this could mean that Virginia is either an outlier in the dataset, or the model has low prediction accuracy. There is also no evidence of multicollinearity in the predictors as evidenced by the VIF values, which were all lower than 10.  

### Conclusions 
The results of the hypothesis test show that considering the three variables (male, population density, and Black race), they help to provide meaningful information about median income across states. The inclusion of the Black race population in the model demonstrates that there is evidence that race is related to median household income. States with larger male populations tend to have slightly higher median household incomes; although the effect is small, it was statistically significant. Furthermore, the results show that states with a higher population density tend to have slightly lower median incomes on average, and states with higher Black racial proportions are predicted to have slightly higher incomes, though this relationship was not statistically significant. The population density was statistically significant as well. The coefficient of determination showed that approximately 23% of the differences in median household income across states can be explained by the combination of male population, Black population, and population density. Though the model captures meaningful patterns, the coefficient of determination showed that there are many other factors contributing to income that are not included in this model.  

One of the primary limitations is the small sample size since the United States only has a fixed number of states. When multiple predictors in a small sample are combined, the statistical power is limited, and individual predictors do not appear to be as significant as they are in reality, which leads to the next limitation of missing important predictors. Median household income is impacted by many factors, such as education levels, employment rates, urbanization, which are all factors not accounted for in the model. Also, demographic variables may not be directly causal, since they are descriptors and not economic drivers. One of the issues surrounding the data overall is that each observation represents millions of people, which leads to ecological fallacy risks, where relationships seen in the data may not hold for individuals or smaller communities within a state.  

In a generalized context, these findings suggest that demographic and population factors contribute to understanding economic differences across states, but much of the variation remains unexplained. The relationships found were small and should be interpreted cautiously, as they are not statistically significant on their own, and cannot be used to predict median income past the dataset. Future research with a more comprehensive set of predictors and nonlinear modeling techniques would help provide a complete understanding of the factors that drive income differences in the United States.
