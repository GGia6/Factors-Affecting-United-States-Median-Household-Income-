# Factors Affecting Median Household Income in the United States

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between race and different thresholds median household income, using a sample of 48 states from the United States. The variables included in analysis are: Social Security income, Public Assistance, population and population density, as well as the racial and gender proportions per state to determine the factors that surround median income.

For readability AI_AN pertains to the American Indian/ Alaskan Native racial group.

## Project Components

## Data
The analysis uses a cleaned dataset derived from publicly available sources.

- Cleaned data are stored in the `data/` folder
- All preprocessing and transformations were performed in R
- No sensitive or personally identifiable information is included

---

## Methods

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was conducted using graphical techniques to understand variable distributions and relationships, including:
- Histograms and density plots
- Scatterplots
- Summary statistics

### Statistical Analysis
Linear regression models were used to assess relationships between variables of interest.

### Assumption Checks
Model assumptions were evaluated using graphical diagnostics, including:
- Q–Q plots to assess normality
- Residual plots to assess linearity and homoscedasticity
